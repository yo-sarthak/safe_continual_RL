"""Curriculum training across multiple environments or difficulty levels.

This module provides utilities for:
1. Sequential training across difficulty levels (e.g., safe_ant_level_1 -> level_2 -> level_3)
2. Continuing training with warm-started parameters

Example usage:
    from brax.training import curriculum
    from brax.training.agents import ppo_lag

    # Define curriculum stages
    stages = [
        curriculum.Stage(env_name='safe_ant_level_1', num_steps=1_000_000),
        curriculum.Stage(env_name='safe_ant_level_2', num_steps=1_000_000),
        curriculum.Stage(env_name='safe_ant_level_3', num_steps=1_000_000),
    ]

    # Train with curriculum
    policy_fn, final_params, results, eval_env = curriculum.train_curriculum(
        stages=stages,
        train_fn=ppo_lag.train,
        train_kwargs={'episode_length': 1000, 'num_envs': 2048},
        seed=42,
    )
