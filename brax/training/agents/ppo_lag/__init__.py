"""PPO-Lagrange training algorithm.

This module extends PPO with Lagrangian-based constrained optimization
for safe reinforcement learning.

Provides PPO-Lagrange specific components:
  - networks: PPONetworks with cost_value_network
  - losses: PPO-Lagrange loss with Lagrange multiplier
  - train: Training loop with Lagrange multiplier updates
